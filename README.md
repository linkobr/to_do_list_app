# To-do list Webapp!

A to-do list web application that allows the user to add, edit, save, and delete tasks.

## Why? 

I created this to-do list webapp in order to practice my web development skills, especially in JavaScript. I also wanted to create my own online to-do list to track my school work assignments.

## How?

This web application was made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
